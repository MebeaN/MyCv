            <p>#4, Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? Why ? </p>
            <br>
            <article>
                <p> When we use relative size the webpage becomes flexible whenever we change the size of the browser. This means when we resize the browser the webpage contents become visible all the time. This is because the webpage is relative to the size of the whole window. It resizes as a response to the size of the window.

            <p>#5, We said 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px ? How does the browser interpret that ? </p><br>
            <p> In my observation 200px means the contents' size will increase that much or they will be zoomed in. When we write a content saying ABCD with ont size 200px the text will be as large as 12.5(200/16) times of the default 16px text</p>

            <p>#6 Explain in detail(in technical terms) the specific changes in css3</p>
            <br>
            <article>
                One specific change in css3 is that the introduction of RGBA which is a color which has transparency property. The A is called Alpha which ranges between 0 and 1. If it is closest to 1, it means the color is not transparent at all. It becomes equal to RGB.
            <br><br>
            Another property is transform property which will rotate an element with any degree specified. When we wanted to do this before css3, we could have used javascript. If the degree is 180, the content will rotate upside down.
                <br><br>
                
            Shadows are another special things in css3. There are 2 types of shadows namely text shadows and drop shadows.
            Text shadows are shadows that have the shape of the text behind it. Drop shadows are shadows of some box. This applies mostly for containers like div.
            <br><br>
            There are more changes in css3 but the most fascinating one is that it is backward compatible. This means it can work with older versions. Older sites worked with older versions can be rebuilt with css3.
